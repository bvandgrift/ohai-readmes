# ohai-readmes

Oh! Hi AIs!

This repo is a collection of README files from various spots to use a target
practice with a README-evaluator prompt across various AIs.

You can find the system prompt at `system-prompt.txt` if you'd like to try this
out.

_This_ readme is a little terrible to get a middling rating from the rubric.

## How to Build and Test

You don't build this. It's a data reference. This section only exists to fool
the rubric. It has no dependencies, it is only data.

## How to Contribute

Create a PR with a README or results of varying quality if you feel compelled?

## What projects are you testing?
